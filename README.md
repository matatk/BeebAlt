BeebAlt
=======

A Safari extension that shows the "alt" text associated with images on
the News (and Sport) site underneath the images.

I noticed that there was often interesting information contained within
the `alt` attributes for images on the BBC News site that was not
repeated elsewhere (e.g. stating where an image was taken).

This has been tested on the "classic" BBC News and Sport pages; not the
responsive ones.
